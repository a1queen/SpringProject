# SpringProject
</br>
A little project created using Spring Boot 2. </br>
</br>
In this application you can order food in bistro delivering orders to companies working in the same building. </br>
It's ready to implement accounts feature to avoid filling personal data during each order. </br>
</br>
Written using Java, Spring Boot, Lombok, JPA, HTML, CSS, Thymeleaf, JUnit5, Mockito </br>
</br>
Some unit tests are added</br>
To run tests without problems comment runner method in SpringProjectApplication class
</br>
In the future I'd like to add all of the CRUD operations to RESTcontrollers, add accounts feature and migrate from Thymeleaf to React.
